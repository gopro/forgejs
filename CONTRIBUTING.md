## Support

Personal support issues **are not allowed** on the issue tracker, so please seek help on the [community forum](https://forum.forgejs.org/). Before asking for help in the forum, you can also do those things :

+ read the [documentation](https://forgejs.org/documentation)

## Issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/gopro/forgejs/issues) is the best place to report a bug, suggest a new feature for the player, request documentation (support) and contribute with code to the project. Please make sure to check the following guide on how to use the issue tracker :

### Reporting a bug

- Make sure it is a bug, and not a bad configuration on your side. See [the section above](#support) to help you find the root of your problem.
- If you really think it is a bug, consult the list of issues and make sure nobody has reported it yet. This will avoid duplication of effort.
- If it hasn't been reported yet, submit a new issue.

### Suggesting a feature

- Consult the roadmap to know if it is planned.
- Consult the list of things that **won't** be implemented.
- Read up on what type of feature requests are accepted.
- See if anybody has not requested the feature yet.
- If it hasn't been requested yet, submit a new request as an issue.

### Submitting a pull-request

- All contributors must sign a [contributor license agreement (CLA)](https://cla.gopro.com). Your code will not be reviewed and accepted by the Admins until this has been received.
- To be sure your changes could be interesting and accepted, ask about your patch on Discourse.
- Fork the repository and work on the `master` branch, while respecting the imposed guidelines.
- Add tests if needed, and make sure that all of them pass.
- Document the code according to the guidelines, and make sure the build is OK. If you encounter some problem with the Closure Compiler part, don't hesitate to ask.
- Submit a pull request for your changes.
- The Admins will review your work and may optionally request conformance, functional or other changes. Work with them to resolve any issues.
- Upon acceptance, your code will be added to the main branch and available for all.

## Style guide

Beside the [guidelines guide](GUIDELINES.md), get the global idea [here](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es5-deprecated/es5), but please respect also these conventions :

- 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- use semicolons
- write attractive code
- lines with an acceptable length (80 characters not necessary, but don't abuse it)
- always use braces, even for single line blocks
- always comment your code

## Contact

If you have any question about contributing, ask on the [community forum](https://forum.forgejs.org/) of the project.
