## Overview

ForgeJS is a modern web-based engine built on standard technologies (HTML5, Javascript and WebGL) that runs on every modern browser to unleash immersive VR content experiences.
It's not only a VR engine, it's a framework for authoring VR content. You can use ForgeJS even if you do not have advanced programming skills: ForgeJS is able to read a configuration file and create the experience from it.

## Quick Start for users

The easiest way to learn how to build a project with ForgeJS is to practice with our [tutorials](https://forgejs.org/tutorials) and get inspiration from our [samples](https://forgejs.org/samples) that are available online.

## Quick Start for Developers

### Setup

1. Clone the project from [GitHub](https://github.com/gopro/forgejs) (`git clone https://github.com/gopro/forgejs`).
2. Install nodejs and npm on your machine (download [here](http://nodejs.org)).
3. Install the grunt-cli npm package (`npm install -g grunt grunt-cli` will install grunt globally on your machine).
4. Install the node dev dependencies of the project (`cd forgejs && npm install`).

### Build ForgeJS

You can now run grunt tasks from the project repo folder. Here is a short list of useful grunt tasks:

Build a non minified build of ForgeJS:
```
grunt build
```

Build a minified build of ForgeJS:
```
grunt min // without logs on FORGE.DEBUG = true
grunt min:debug // with logs
```

Generate the documentation and the json reference:
```
grunt doc
```

Auto watch any changes you made in sources to auto build a non minified build of ForgeJS:
```
grunt watch:build
```
