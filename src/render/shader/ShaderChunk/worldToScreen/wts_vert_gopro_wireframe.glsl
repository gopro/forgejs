/**
 * Vertex shader
 * GoPro view projection
 *
 * To fit with screen to world projection, world points are first projected on a unit sphere (normalized)
 * Then sphere points are scaled and shifted by a negative offset on z-axis to simulate projection from
 * a point at a distance from sphere center.
 * Finally, projectionMatrix is applied to project from origin that is no more the origin of the sphere.
 * Note: FOV used to update projection matrix should be computed to take scale and offset into account.
